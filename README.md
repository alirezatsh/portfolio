# Simple Flask Project

This project is a simple web application built using **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Flask-SQLAlchemy**. It was created for personal learning and to better understand core web development concepts such as integrating frontend and backend technologies and working with databases.

### Features

- **Frontend**: Basic HTML and CSS to design the user interface.
- **Backend**: Flask handles routing and requests, providing a lightweight structure for the application.
- **Database**: **Flask-SQLAlchemy** is used to manage data storage and retrieval in a simple SQLite database.

### Project Structure

- **portfolio.py**: The main Flask application file, where routes and logic are defined.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML files for the frontend.
- **static/**: Holds CSS files for styling the application.

### Purpose

This project was created primarily for learning purposes. By building this simple app, I gained hands-on experience working with Flask, handling HTML and CSS for the frontend, and utilizing Flask-SQLAlchemy to interact with a database. It's a fundamental project that helped me solidify my understanding of web development concepts.
